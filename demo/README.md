#Project Name ![badges](http://img.shields.io/badge/badges-here-green.svg?style=flat-square)

You should aim to describe your project in one to two meaningful and concise paragraphs. Elaborate on the what and briefly describe the why. Let the documentation speak for itself to minimize pain points as you iterate through versions. Finally, your last paragraph should reference the vendor or individual responsible for the project and any pointed information.
